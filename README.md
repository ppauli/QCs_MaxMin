# QCs_MaxMin

This repository was used for the experiments of the paper "Novel Quadratic Constraints for Extending LipSDP beyond Slope-Restricted Activations" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=HfXDrAzFvG), accepted for presentation at ICLR 2024.

The Lipschitz analysis is performed in Matlab using Yalmip (https://yalmip.github.io/) and the solver Mosek (https://www.mosek.com/).
